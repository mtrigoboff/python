seattle amazoncom is expected to report its first profit this week
a pro forma operating one that excludes many costs but is nonetheless
seen by wall street as an important sign the online superstore can
eventually make real money

the company which is to report fourth quarter results tuesday is also
expected to show smaller net and operating losses the result of
stronger than expected holiday sales analysts said

seattle based amazon is expected to post a pro forma net loss of between
 cents and  cents a share according to wall street tracking firm
thomson financial first call that compares to a loss of  cents a year
ago

that number includes interest payments which amount to  million a
year  but not other costs like acquisition charges that are found in the
true net figure

while amazon is seen as still a long way from a net profit founder and
chief executive jeff bezos has promised to at least break even this
quarter on a pro forma operating basis

obviously its a pretty important quarter for the company i do think
theyll hit the target of a pro forma operating profit but i expect it
to be break even or for a slight profit said wr hambrecht analyst
kristine koerber

revenues are seen growing about  percent to  billion according
to first call many analysts think the strong holiday season means sales
could be higher with the top estimate being for  billion

this was the quarter that amazon had fine tuned its pricing and product
offering and with fairly low expectations we believe it could easily
beat the current estimates us bancorp piper jaffray analyst safa
rashtchy said in a research note

questions remain

amazon stock which started the year with a bang as holiday optimism
pushed the share price from single digits to more than  has slipped
since then though it rose more than  percent to close at  on
friday

we believe amazon has entered the upward move having reached the
bottom both in its fundamentals and stock price rashtchy said

but wr hambrechts koerber said amazon still faced major challenges
namely how to rekindle falling sales in its core books music and video
segment that still accounts for more than half its sales

and while it has had success with sales of electronics the company is
struggling to nurture other new product lines like kitchen goods and
tools

i still have concerns about the companys business model and long term
profitability or lack thereof koerber said they are trying to gain
traction in these new areas and trying to revive the core business they
have a lot going on

as its main business of selling goods online directly has come under
pressure amazon has also branched into selling used items and
licensing its e commerce platform to retailers like toys r us and
target

those segments are only a small fraction of revenues but they carry
very high profit margins and are seen as crucial to the companys
prospects of making profits over the long haul

as usual analysts will be listening carefully to see what amazon says
about its current quarter and the coming year

for its first quarter amazon is expected to lose between  cents and 
cents a share on revenues of about  million for all  it is
seen losing between  cents and  cents a share with sales of 
billion according to first call

prior to  it was all about growth at the expense of profits and
last year was about profits at the expense of growth i think this year
they will try to find a balance said jeetil patel an analyst with
deutsche bank alex brown
